I am Bèr Kessels, a freelance **webdeveloper**, focused on development and
marketing of **cutting edge** websites, with **Open Source technology**. I am
based in Nijmegen, Netherlands, and can work from home or at your venue.

My handle on most networks is **berkes**.

## Contact
You can contact me about work by [email](ber@webschuur.com) or phone
(+31)(0)629075065.

## Drupal
I used to develop in Drupal. For over 10 years, that was the one and
only environment I worked, trained people in, developed with, and gave
consultancy about. 

## Ruby and Ruby on Rails
Nowadays I mostly develop in Ruby on Rails, a framework that fits my and
my clients' needs far better: I am a webdeveloper who wants to give
clients a web-application that is 100% the way they want it. I love
that. And I love new stuff.

This is my personal and corporate blog. You will find thoughts,
opinions, manuals and nice findings on this blog.
