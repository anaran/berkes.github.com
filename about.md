I am Bèr Kessels, a freelance webdeveloper, focused on development and
marketing of cutting edge websites, with Open Source technology.

I used to develop in Drupal. For over 10 years, that was the one and
only environment I worked, trained people in, developed with, and gave
consultancy about. 

Nowadays I mostly develop in Ruby on Rails, a framework that fits my and
my clients' needs far better: I am a webdeveloper who wants to give
clients a web-application that is 100% the way they want it. I love
that. And I love new stuff.

This is my personal and corporate blog. You will find thoughts,
opinions, manuals and nice findings on this blog.
